TeachBook is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is targeted towards teachers who can type fast. It allows teachers to store and organise contacts related to their students into different classes. On top of that, teachers can tag the class role of the student.
