## What is TeachBook?

TeachBook is a **desktop app for primary and secondary school teachers to manage student contacts, optimized for use via
a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is targeted 
towards teachers who can type fast. It allows teachers to store and organise contacts related to their students into 
different classes. On top of that, teachers can tag the class role of the student.
