## What is TeachBook?

TeachBook is a **desktop app for primary and secondary school teachers to manage student contacts, optimized for use via
a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is targeted 
towards teachers who can type fast. It allows teachers to store and organise contacts related to their students into 
different classes. On top of that, teachers can tag the class role of the student.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your computer.

2. Download the latest `teachbook-v1.3.1.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/releases/download/v1.3.1/teachbook-v1.3.1.jar).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TeachBook.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * **`select Talent`** : Displays all the students from the class named `Talent`.
   
    * **`delete`**`2` : Deletes the 2nd student shown in the list on the right.

    * **`addClass`**`Class D` : Adds a new class named `Class D` to the TeachBook.
    
    * **`clear`** : Clears all existing data in the TeachBook.

    * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Graphical User Interface

In this section, we will be guiding you through the different sections of TeachBook's Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
There are a total of 5 different sections according to the image of out GUI below (highlighted in red) and they are the:
* Menu Bar (Place to access more features)
* Command Box (Place for you to type in the command)
* Result Display (Place that displays the result of the command. It shows error messages too)
* Class List (Place where you can see the list of classes that you have added)
* Student List (Place where you can see the list of students that you have added)

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Xin Yi`.

* The parameter `INDEX` refers to the index number currently shown in the displayed student list, and it must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Joseph Chan t/class monitor` or as `n/Joseph Chan`.

* Items **in** square brackets with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as <code>&nbsp;</code> (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Items **outside** square brackets with `…` after them can be used multiple times but at least once.<br>
  e.g. `INDEX…` can be used as `1`, `2 3`, `1 4 5 9` etc.

* Items separated by `||` means only one of the partitioned items should be supplied.<br>
  e.g. `sort name||grade` can be used as either `sort name` or `sort grade`, but not `sort name grade`.

* If a command accepts more than one parameter (i.e. word in `UPPER_CASE`), parameters can be in any order. However, this does not apply to parameter `INDEX`, which should always be specified before others.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the **last** occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

Examples:
* `find John Doe` returns only one `John Doe` from the currently selected class, even though there is another `John Doe` from a different class.
* `list all` followed by `find John Doe` returns two `John Doe`, assuming that there are two `John Doe` in the entire the TeachBook, one from class `A` and another one from class `B`.

which may differ from semester to semester and subject to subject in order to grade your students accordingly.
Grades are set in descending order, from the highest to the lowest grade.

Format: `setGrade GRADE_1[>GRADE_2]…`

Example:
* `setGrade A>B>C>D` sets the grading system where A is the highest grade and D is the lowest grade.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**

Example:
* `grade 1 g/B` gives the student at index 1 a B grade.
* `grade 2 4 5 g/A` gives the 2nd, 4th, and 5th students A grades.

</div>

### Resetting the grading system : `resetGrade`

Teachbook can only incorporate at most 1 grading system at any time. Therefore, you have to wipe out an existing
grading system before implementing a new one. This command not only resets the grading system, but also wipes out
all the grades which were previously given to the students.

Format: `resetGrade`

### Sorting students : `sort`

Unorganised lists are a pain to see. Therefore, TeachBook provides the functionality for you to sort your students either according to their name or grade.

* `mark 2 3 4` marks the students at index 2, 3 and 4 as present.
* `mark all` marks all the students present.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Info**

once the attendance of the student is marked! 
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
After marking, you can retrieve the attendance list with the `print c/attendance` command. You might also want to check out the [print](#printing-to-excel--print) command for more special columns available to be added.
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Info**
This command allows you to unmark multiple indexes at once. Which can save you lots of time! The check box will turn red
once the attendance of the student is unmarked!
</div>

Shows the list of all students from the currently selected class or the entire TeachBook.

Format: `list [all||absent]`

* `list` lists all students from the currently selected class or the entire TeachBook.

Generates an Excel file containing students in the currently shown list.

Format: `print [c/class] [c/phone] [c/email] [c/tags] [c/remark] [c/grade] [c/attendance] [c/COLUMN_TITLE]…`

* First column is always the names of students in the currently shown list.
* You can add one or more empty columns with customized titles.

### Editing the data file

TeachBook data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/teachbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TeachBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
</div>
